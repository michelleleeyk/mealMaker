# Meal Maker
Simple project to practice JavaScript Objects. </br>
This program allows users to input their favorite dishes, and it will generate a random meal consisting of an appetizer, main course and dessert.


### To Run
console.log(menu.generateRandomMeal());

### Future Plans
Could be interesting to categorise dishes based on their cuisines, allowing users to generate a random meal based on their cravings. </br>
Would be nice as a web app with simple UI
